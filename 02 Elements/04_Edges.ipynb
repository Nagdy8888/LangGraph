    "# Edges in LangGraph: Connecting the Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "Edges are the connections between nodes in a LangGraph that define how data flows through your application. They determine the execution path and control the sequence of operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features:\n",
    "- **Flow Control**: Define the order of node execution\n",
    "- **Data Routing**: Direct state from one node to another\n",
    "- **Conditional Logic**: Enable dynamic path selection based on state\n",
    "- **Graph Structure**: Create the overall workflow architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Edges:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Simple Edges**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Direct, unconditional flow from one node to another\n",
    "- **Use Case**: Sequential processing where the next step is always the same\n",
    "- **Syntax**: `graph.add_edge(\"node1\", \"node2\")`\n",
    "- **Example**: Process input → Generate response → Update history\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Conditional Edges**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Dynamic routing based on state conditions\n",
    "- **Use Case**: Decision-making and branching logic\n",
    "- **Syntax**: `graph.add_conditional_edges(\"node\", condition_func, routing_dict)`\n",
    "- **Example**: Classify query → Route to weather/news/support handler\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Entry Edges**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Define the starting point of the graph\n",
    "- **Use Case**: Set the initial node for execution\n",
    "- **Syntax**: `graph.set_entry_point(\"start_node\")`\n",
    "- **Example**: Always start with user input processing\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Exit Edges**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Define termination conditions\n",
    "- **Use Case**: Determine when the graph execution should stop\n",
    "- **Syntax**: Implicit when no more edges are available\n",
    "- **Example**: End after generating final response\n",
    "\n",
    "## Edge Patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Linear Flow**\n",
    "```\n",
    "START → Node A → Node B → Node C → END\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Simple sequential processing\n",
    "- Each node leads to exactly one next node\n",
    "- Predictable execution path\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Branching Flow**\n",
    "```\n",
    "START → Classifier → [Weather Handler]\n",
    "                    [News Handler]\n",
    "                    [Support Handler]\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Conditional routing based on state\n",
    "- Multiple possible paths from one node\n",
    "- Dynamic execution based on conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Converging Flow**\n",
    "```\n",
    "[Node A] → [Node C] → END\n",
    "[Node B] → [Node C] → END\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Multiple paths converge to the same node\n",
    "- Useful for parallel processing that merges results\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Practices:\n",
    "- **Clear Naming**: Use descriptive names for nodes and edges\n",
    "- **Single Responsibility**: Each edge should have one clear purpose\n",
    "- **Error Handling**: Consider what happens when conditions fail\n",
    "- **Documentation**: Document complex routing logic\n",
    "- **Testing**: Test all possible paths through your graph\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Use Cases:\n",
    "- **Workflow Orchestration**: Define business process flows\n",
    "- **Decision Trees**: Implement complex decision logic\n",
    "- **Error Handling**: Route to error handling nodes\n",
    "- **Parallel Processing**: Split work across multiple paths\n",
    "- **State Validation**: Check conditions before proceeding\n",
    "\n",
    "## Edge Functions:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def should_continue(state):\n",
    "    return \"continue\" if state[\"count\"] < 10 else \"finish\"\n",
    "\n",
    "def route_by_type(state):\n",
    "    return state[\"query_type\"]  # \"weather\", \"news\", \"support\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits:\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: Easy to modify workflow without changing node logic\n",
    "- **Reusability**: Same nodes can be connected differently\n",
    "- **Debugging**: Clear execution path for troubleshooting\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Add new paths without affecting existing ones\n",
    "- **Maintainability**: Separate routing logic from processing logic\n"
