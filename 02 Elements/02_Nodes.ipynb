    "# Nodes in LangGraph: The Building Blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "Nodes are the fundamental processing units in a LangGraph. Each node represents a specific function or operation that can read from and write to the shared state. Nodes are the \"workers\" that perform the actual computation in your graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features:\n",
    "- **State Access**: Nodes can read the current state and return state updates\n",
    "- **Functional**: Each node is a pure function that takes state and returns state updates\n",
    "- **Modular**: Nodes can be developed and tested independently\n",
    "- **Composable**: Nodes can be connected to create complex workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "## Node Structure:\n",
    "- **Input**: Receives the current state as input\n",
    "- **Processing**: Performs specific computation or logic\n",
    "- **Output**: Returns state updates (partial state changes)\n",
    "- **Type Safety**: Can be typed for better IDE support and error checking\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Node Types:\n",
    "- **LLM Nodes**: Call language models for text generation\n",
    "- **Processing Nodes**: Transform, filter, or analyze data\n",
    "- **Decision Nodes**: Make routing decisions based on state\n",
    "- **Tool Nodes**: Execute external tools or APIs\n",
    "- **Validation Nodes**: Check data quality or constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "## Node Functions:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def my_node(state: State) -> dict:\n",
    "    # Read from state\n",
    "    input_data = state.get(\"input\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Process data\n",
    "    result = process_data(input_data)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Return state update\n",
    "    return {\"result\": result}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits:\n",
    "- **Modularity**: Each node has a single responsibility\n",
    "- **Reusability**: Nodes can be reused across different graphs\n",
    "- **Testability**: Individual nodes can be unit tested\n",
    "- **Debugging**: Easy to trace execution through specific nodes\n",
    "- **Parallelization**: Nodes can potentially run in parallel\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Practices:\n",
    "- Keep nodes focused on a single task\n",
    "- Use descriptive names for node functions\n",
    "- Handle errors gracefully within nodes\n",
    "- Return only the state changes needed\n",
    "- Document node inputs and outputs clearly\n"
